Responses:
Told we have access and support but when you need it it’s not there.
Ok
Look at how they’ve treated us. No relief from inflationary pressures. Shows in their financials. Thieves. I hate everything about this business. They’ve ruined me. 
Nine
Negotiation... pricing way off target ... after numerous submittals, corporate agreed that the regional engineering was busy and did a poor job, had to be redone/restarted
It is the Flavor of the Week what FedEx wants to manage or change rules
When I started this venture, I thought it was a partnership, our terminal makes it us versus them
18 years of business together.
They are in it for themselves.
Our station management is great. Engineering either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care how cubic feet of packages and bulk cargo is impacting our efficiency and profitability. 
Terrible
none
The management doesn't care about their contractors but hold us accountable for their mistakes
Their estimate for the number of deliveries I need to plan for is off every day by 10-30%. They have done nothing to improve this, even though it is the largest driver of inefficiency I have 
None
They just need to stay out of my way.  Do that and everything will be fine. 
Senior manager last week asked me to buy out another contractor
The FedEx Negotiator laughing during our call summed it up for me. 
Went to one of the Senior Exec sharing sessions back in November 2022.  Execs claimed they were listening and make positive changes.  Nothing has changed.  Have lost complete trust in executive management at FedEx

We have several contracts.  A Contractor about 5 hours away from us walked away from their contract with zero notice.  We were asked to run contingency so we did.  We brought drivers, trucks, ipads, scanners and everything else needed to get it done.  We were up and running in a terminal five hours away from our within two days....we ran for six weeks and had the terminal caught up.  It was a complete shit show.  FedEx missed several payments to us and when we did get paid, it was always the wrong amount.  We floated tens of thousands of dollars to make it happen and had to fight to get paid.  The terminal manager was the worst person I've ever worked with at FedEx.  I made sure that we only communicated via email or text so that I had record of his behavior and ineptitude.  Doing the contingency work hurt our overall service for the company under which we ran contingency.  We took all of the risk and ended up breaking even.  In the end we gave notice and walked away.  We did everything in our power to bail FedEx out and were met with problem after problem on the FedEx side that they were unwilling or too inept to fix.  We will never run contingency again. 
I have tried to build a solid relationship w the terminal staff.  I have realized that they can be a very good tool to assist me in the early stages of building my company
Stop pushing more on us and let us run our business 
Adversarial relationship - any request to “review” a policy or accident expense is immediately returned as “the decision stands” without any further explanation or true investigation. When it’s not their money, they are very quick to shut down any dialogue 
In spite of the constant micromanagement and rule changes and moving the line and taking two steps forward and getting knocked back three I have managed to stay in business 31 plus years. I enjoy what I do.
We bring up inflation, higher cost, try to adjust schedule k….crickets, it’s all correct and that’s all you’re getting
We are the solution to the problem. The company that we work with is unable to perform at the level of service that we provide. 



ChatGPT Response
The survey responses vividly depict a range of experiences that contractors have with FedEx, revealing a complex and often strained relationship. A common theme across many responses is a sense of disillusionment and frustration, with contractors feeling undervalued, unsupported, and at times, exploited. Key points of contention include:

Lack of Support and Transparency: Contractors express dissatisfaction with the lack of access to necessary support and transparent communication, feeling left to navigate challenges on their own.
Financial and Operational Strain: Many respondents highlight the financial pressures they face, particularly due to inflation, and perceive a lack of effort from FedEx to provide relief or fair compensation. The strain is exacerbated by operational inefficiencies, such as inaccurate delivery estimates, which significantly impact contractors' ability to plan and execute their work effectively.
Adversarial Relationship: The sentiment that the relationship between FedEx and its contractors is more adversarial than collaborative is a recurring theme. This is epitomized by experiences of negotiation difficulties, perceived indifference to contractors' operational realities, and unilateral rule changes by FedEx.
Instances of Neglect and Inefficiency: Some contractors share specific instances that underscore their challenges, such as unpaid contingency work, mismanagement, and unmet promises from FedEx's senior management. These experiences contribute to a feeling of being overburdened and underappreciated.
One particularly insightful response that encapsulates the broader sentiment is: "We have several contracts. A Contractor about 5 hours away from us walked away from their contract with zero notice. We were asked to run contingency so we did... FedEx missed several payments to us and when we did get paid, it was always the wrong amount... Doing the contingency work hurt our overall service... We took all of the risk and ended up breaking even... We will never run contingency again." This response vividly illustrates the challenges of operating under the current model, highlighting issues of financial risk, lack of support, and operational inefficiency.

In summary, the typical and aggregate response from contractors paints a picture of a challenging and often unsatisfactory relationship with FedEx. Contractors feel that their efforts and contributions are not adequately recognized or compensated, leading to financial strain and operational difficulties. The need for more supportive, transparent, and equitable practices from FedEx is clear, as is the desire for a more genuine partnership that acknowledges and addresses contractors' challenges and concerns.
