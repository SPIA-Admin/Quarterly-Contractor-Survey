Survey Question:
"Can you share a specific challenge you've faced in the past year and how you addressed it?"
Responses:
Getting employees approved in a timely fashion
Fleet maintenance. I employed a full time fleet technician to take care of all small maintenance issues. PMs, tires, brakes etc
Showing profit
Increase in rates. No new equipment. Deferring maintenance. 
Hiring drivers in GA was taking almost2 months to get through the process. Hired AVP drivers instead
Contract pricing - moved to 50% stops in AVPs
Price of tires and fuel
Contract negotiations never take into account special circumstances.  
Sunday specifically is a challenge because we do not have enough freight to actually run seven days a week. Consequently it is a payroll burden.
Labor costs are through the roof with no help from FedEx. I’ve changed my schedule around and offered unlimited days off without pay.
Keeping qualified drivers.

Hired a  recruiting company to find new employees.
Cut down on maintenance costs buy acquiring a service truck and hiring mechanic
Contract failing to cover expenses. We’ve shopped and switched vendors for lower rates.
Company seems to be clueless on sa daily basis when it comes to package count the night before 
Pay we get less and less for pay while inflation and wages go up.  26% less pay than before pandemic. 
poor contract rate
Sort and package handlers is the worst I have ever seen. I can't fix it
Discrimination - harassment- threats
Forced to run ASA 40 miles from my nearest stop for 6 months. I demanded Contingency pay and got it. 
Declining volume, nightly DRO inaccuracies from 5-25% off, both high and low with no trend
Quality of work force. I made an effort or over hire and replace the bad seeds and change the. Corporate culture 
Our new contract. Worked for hours on the unique characteristics. Actually had a FedEx negotiator laugh at me on the phone. 
Keeping my fleet in working condition 
Violation of contract and retaliation after pursuing a case with contract relations. There is no resolution seemingly 
Vehicle costs are through the roof.  We turned to Enterprise leasing.  it's expensive up front but for the long term, it ends up normalizing costs over serveral years and we will always have fairly new vehicles.  

Additionally, we have had a lot of issues with the available workforce and their willingness to show up when they're supposed to.  We have started hiring so we have more people than we need so we can start weeding out bad drivers.  We have decided we will never be held prisoner by our employees again.

Our contracts have been reducded year over year across the board.  One small contract, our revenue dropped almost 15%...not because we delivered less but because FedEx gives us less money per stop, less money per package and less money for fuel.  We have the exact same CSA for that contract. We cannot fathom how FedEx could reduce all of our revenue when the cost of labor, fuel and equipment has gone up drastically.  We have had to utilize managers quite a bit more to drive and fill routes which takes a lot of time from their ability to do things that improve the company and help service. 
As a relatively new contractor, I went from all business contract to a mix of home/business.  I thought the drivers would find the transition easy to more stops lighter packages.  They didn't and I had to overhaul my entire staff.
Inflation costs
Contract was at risk of not being renewed. Most stressful time in my entire life. Suffered health problems as a result. 
FedEx constantly micromanaging your business. They are constantly moving the bar and changing the rules of the game midstream. The biggest thing is navigating FedEx's micromanagement techniques. Also inadequate information as far as numbers go. Late dispatches inconsistent dispatch times.
Ability to schedule properly 
Dealing w terrible loaders and loading truck myself
In order to get more efficient, I got bigger trucks and each truck does about 10-15% more per route than the same route a year ago.
Having a lower offer at negotiations in an inflationary environment. 



The survey responses reveal a wide array of challenges faced by individuals in the past year, primarily centered around operational and financial difficulties within their businesses. Key themes emerge around issues such as hiring difficulties, fleet maintenance, financial strain due to increased costs and reduced contract rates, and the challenge of maintaining profitability amidst these adversities. Respondents have taken various actions to address their challenges, including hiring specialized staff such as fleet technicians and recruiting companies, shifting to alternative vendor agreements for better rates, leasing vehicles to manage upfront costs, and adjusting operational strategies such as scheduling and workforce management to improve efficiency and reduce dependency on unreliable factors.

One particularly insightful response highlighted the struggle with contract negotiations and the perceived indifference of FedEx towards the operational and financial realities faced by contractors: "Our contracts have been reduced year over year across the board. One small contract, our revenue dropped almost 15%...not because we delivered less but because FedEx gives us less money per stop, less money per package and less money for fuel. We have the exact same CSA for that contract. We cannot fathom how FedEx could reduce all of our revenue when the cost of labor, fuel and equipment has gone up drastically." This response captures the sentiment of frustration and the sense of being undervalued and unfairly compensated, which resonates with the broader issues of financial pressures and the challenge of negotiating fair terms in an environment where costs are escalating.

In summary, the typical response reflects a combination of operational challenges and financial pressures, with businesses taking proactive steps to mitigate these issues through strategic hiring, vendor renegotiations, operational adjustments, and financial management strategies. The aggregate response indicates a sector grappling with increasing costs, logistical challenges, and the need for more supportive and fair contract negotiations.
