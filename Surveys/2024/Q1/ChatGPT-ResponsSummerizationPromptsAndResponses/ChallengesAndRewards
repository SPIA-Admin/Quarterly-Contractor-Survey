Survey Question:
"What's one thing you wish outsiders knew about the challenges and rewards of being a Service Provider contractor?"
Responses:
We are at the mercy of the parent company in all things. Employees without benefits or protections 
This is not a passive income type venture! If you’re not prepared to be at the terminal on a regular basis, let alone not prepared to don a uniform and get behind the wheel to deliver packages, then don’t waste your time. Have a solid understanding of our logistics world and ensure that you have a good culture embedded in your company. 
How bad the parent company treats the isp 
More work less money
Not to do it. 
As soon as you sign a contract you have 1 foot in the grave. You need to try and keep the second foot above. 
We make cents on the dollar compared to fedex
I don't want them to know, I need to sell
Don't do it.  It's not what it once was.  RUN RUN RUN
The rewards are investing a lot of your money, and not getting any return on your investment, negotiations are not a negotiation!
That we take all the risk with very little reward.
Financially and emotionally stressful. Can cause strains on personal relationships/marriages. Rewards…. You can say you own your own company.
The hours are long, the pay is not.
How important it is that their address is clearly displayed and accessible. 
Companies lie and take your money without real appeal process, outright thievery 
Don’t do it
none
There is no rewards anymore. Challenge is trying to figure out how to dig yourself out of your grave that Fedex puts you into from the beginning
That we put out all the risk and monies and corporate accepts no responsibility unless it’s something that makes them look good 
No comment
Fedex is a terrible business partner
We get our best. Leave your dogs inside if you are expecting a delivery
We aren’t FedEx. People think they are going after a big conglomerate. We are a small business owner just like them. 
The difficulty of being a business owner but at the same time having everything mandated by someone else
FedEx does not give a shit about contractors.  We work so hard to make things happen for FedEx and don't make great profits.  It's a living and supports my family but it is not worth it.  Contractors take all of the risk, take on all of the liability and do not get compensated commensurately for it.  FedEx has the memory of a gold fish. We bail them out all of the time and are met with a constant barrage of texts, phone calls and email about equipment, service and FedEx specific requirments.  Do not invest in this business unless you can go into it with zero debt. 
The inconsistency of the drivers
The terrible pay we make on our contract. 
The contractor is at the financial  mercy of the company. Take it or leave it. Very difficult to do when “leaving it” means walking away from your entire life savings 
It cost more than most people realize to run a business it definitely cost more than what FedEx realizes it does. Just because there's a big number at the end it's not what you gross it's what you keep 
We continue to put in money
Everything…everything falls on contractor shoulders.. weather, late trailers, half the preload employees no show for work, who cares it’s contractors fault it didn’t get delivered for pennies on dollar, every surcharge that’s added each year by the company, we don’t see an increase in pay
We provide a service to our community that is difficult and challenging with a partner that means well but can’t adjust quickly enough to make changes in their operation on a building level to make each driver’s day a little better. 





ChatGPT Response
The responses to this survey question vividly convey the challenging and often disheartening realities faced by Service Provider contractors, particularly those affiliated with FedEx. There's a stark depiction of a relationship characterized by imbalance, where contractors bear the brunt of financial and operational pressures with limited support or fair compensation from the parent company. Key themes include:

Financial and Operational Strain: Contractors highlight the financial challenges and risks involved, including the significant investment required with minimal returns, the stress of being financially tethered to the company, and the perception that they earn "cents on the dollar" compared to the profits of the parent company.
Lack of Autonomy and Support: Many responses express frustration with the lack of autonomy and the feeling of being at the mercy of the parent company's policies and decisions, which can be capricious and poorly communicated. The sense of being an "employee without benefits or protections" underscores the vulnerability of contractors in this relationship.
Misconceptions and Reality: Contractors wish outsiders understood the demanding nature of the work, the misconception of it being a passive income venture, and the importance of having a solid operational and cultural foundation within their companies. They also highlight the misunderstanding by the general public, who often do not realize that these contractors are small business owners facing considerable challenges, not part of a large, impersonal corporation.
Emotional and Personal Toll: The impact on personal well-being and relationships is a significant concern, with the business's financial and emotional stress leading to strains on marriages and personal lives. The constant pressure and lack of adequate rewards contribute to a sentiment of disillusionment and regret among some contractors.
One particularly insightful response that encapsulates the broader sentiment is: "FedEx does not give a shit about contractors. We work so hard to make things happen for FedEx and don't make great profits. It's a living and supports my family but it is not worth it. Contractors take all of the risk, take on all of the liability and do not get compensated commensurately for it. FedEx has the memory of a goldfish. We bail them out all of the time and are met with a constant barrage of texts, phone calls, and email about equipment, service, and FedEx-specific requirements." This response underscores the feeling of being undervalued and exploited, bearing significant risks and responsibilities without commensurate recognition or compensation.

In summary, the typical and aggregate response from contractors paints a picture of a demanding and often unrewarding venture, marked by significant financial investment, operational challenges, and a strained relationship with the parent company. Contractors feel overburdened and underappreciated, yearning for a more equitable, supportive, and respectful partnership.
