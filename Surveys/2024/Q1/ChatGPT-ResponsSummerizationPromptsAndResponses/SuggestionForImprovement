Survey Question:
"If you could suggest one change to improve contractor relations, what would it be?"
Responses:
Partner stop lying
More transparency on how rates are calculated. 
Dispute process for Ryde 
Better contract $
Nothing we say matters. Why bother. 
Get rid of them because they are a waste if money and divide that none within the contractors 
More fair pay. They are making a killing on express and we are taking it over for super cheap rates
Honestly. True Partner ship
FedEx must address it's high internal organization and overhead cost issues, and stop making the quarter financials by reducing contracted prices  
Treat is like partners, not enemies
Ask us what our business cost have increased by. 

Better Pay
Get rid of this ridiculous Sunday service. We do not have enough volume even in the metro areas to continue the service.
That FedEx would listen to contractors more. 
FedEx to understand that wages, repairs, vehicle purchase costs, insurance and fuel are not what they were 10 years ago, and to bring more money to the table so we can survive as a partner to FedEx.
Team wait times are ridiculous
Pay more money 
Increase contract value. 
Be honest and recognize our challenges when presented, lack of interest in our well being 
Pay and be a partner not a dictatorship
management with better knowledge of pick up and delivery operations
Communication more
Enforce the contract uniformly 
I have zero confidence with BDS.  Nothing will change that. 
DRO NEEDS to be more accurate 
To promote incentives for us to make more money, not promote/invent new ways for us to lose money. 
We are your partner. Not the enemy . Treat us like a partner 
Please do more than just listen. Make some positive changes to help contractors. 
Increase contracting rates so we can afford to pay our drivers a fair rate and invest in new trucks
Reasonableness 
Transparency 
FedEx needs to stop forcing regulation after regulation on contractors.  We have to spend so much time training drivers before they can even get on the road....at a great monetary cost.  We do not get compensated properly for the amount of money we have to spend on training.  

Additionally, FedEx knows damn well that most contractors have massive amounts of debt and rely on continuing the relationship to service that debt. When they "negotiate" they give us an ultimatum rather than a true opportunity to negotiate.  Submitting unique characteristics is a joke.  It has to be in the format they provide and you do not have an opporunity to truly submit the characteristics that are unique to your company.  Negotiations should be just that, an ability to speak about what a company reasonably needs to survive without a very short acceptance timeline. 

I have so many more but need to list this one as well.  Station personnel do not know anything about any process other than sorting packages and tracking service.  When we have a question, they rarely have an answer. Often when they do have an answer it's wrong. We have spent so much time finding answers ourselves and completing processes that the terminal should be able to assist with but can't.  It exhausting and frustrating. 
More assistance from FedEx in navigating as a new contractor.  There is absolutely no help.
A better contract with more money
Better pay. 
1) Stop changing the ISP agreement and adding new schedules that only erode the contractor profit margin.  
2) Get rid of ARC. They are more than happy to fork out large sums of “our” money to repair so called damaged property 
The contract relations department does not exist anymore at FedEx.
Improve rates
Go back to old pay system under IC model, isp pay has been terrible ever sense it started and the whole talk leading up isp was how much more money we would make and could negotiate everything, there is 0 negotiating, it’s all take it or leave it, predetermined, shuffle things around to same gross outcome, none of it considers how much inflation is going on or the insane amount of oversized we haul, you should make more money every year not the opposite 
Their needs to be a contractor liaison 
Communication 
Accept that small business owners are taking risk and should be rewarded for that risk. 





The responses to this survey question reflect a broad consensus among contractors on the need for improvements in their relationship with FedEx, with a strong focus on fairness, transparency, and financial viability. The suggestions for change are diverse but center on several key themes:

Transparency and Honesty: Respondents call for more transparency in how rates are calculated and a desire for FedEx to treat contractors as true partners rather than adversaries. This includes a call for honesty and a genuine partnership approach.
Financial Fairness: Many responses emphasize the need for better pay, more fair contract terms, and adjustments to rates that reflect current economic realities, including inflation and increased operational costs.
Operational Improvements: Suggestions include addressing internal organizational issues at FedEx that impact contractors, improving the dispute process, eliminating inefficient services like Sunday delivery, and enhancing the accuracy of delivery routing and scheduling (DRO).
Communication and Support: Contractors seek improved communication, more support from FedEx, especially for new contractors, and a desire for FedEx to listen to and act on contractor feedback more effectively.
One particularly insightful response that encapsulates the broader sentiment is: "FedEx needs to stop forcing regulation after regulation on contractors. We have to spend so much time training drivers before they can even get on the road....at a great monetary cost. We do not get compensated properly for the amount of money we have to spend on training. Additionally, FedEx knows damn well that most contractors have massive amounts of debt and rely on continuing the relationship to service that debt. When they 'negotiate' they give us an ultimatum rather than a true opportunity to negotiate." This response highlights the challenges of regulatory compliance, the financial pressures on contractors, and the perceived imbalance in negotiation power, reflecting a desire for a more equitable, supportive, and collaborative relationship between FedEx and its contractors.

In summary, contractors are seeking significant changes in their relationship with FedEx, centered around financial fairness, transparency, operational efficiency, and improved support and communication. These changes are viewed as essential for creating a more sustainable and mutually beneficial partnership.
