We turned to Enterprise leasing.  it's expensive up front but for the long term, it ends up normalizing costs over serveral years and we will always have fairly new vehicles.  

Additionally, we have had a lot of issues with the available workforce and their willingness to show up when they're supposed to.  We have started hiring so we have more people than we need so we can start weeding out bad drivers.  We have decided we will never be held prisoner by our employees again.

Our contracts have been reducded year over year across the board.  One small contract, our revenue dropped almost 15%...not because we delivered less but because FedEx gives us less money per stop, less money per package and less money for fuel.  We have the exact same CSA for that contract. We cannot fathom how FedEx could reduce all of our revenue when the cost of labor, fuel and equipment has gone up drastically.  We have had to utilize managers quite a bit more to drive and fill routes which takes a lot of time from their ability to do things that improve the company and help service. ","The only positive this year for use what that peak was a success.  We generated a lot of revenue which will help keep the company profitable for the year. ","FedEx needs to stop forcing regulation after regulation on contractors.  We have to spend so much time training drivers before they can even get on the road....at a great monetary cost.  We do not get compensated properly for the amount of money we have to spend on training.  

Additionally, FedEx knows damn well that most contractors have massive amounts of debt and rely on continuing the relationship to service that debt. When they ""negotiate"" they give us an ultimatum rather than a true opportunity to negotiate.  Submitting unique characteristics is a joke.  It has to be in the format they provide and you do not have an opporunity to truly submit the characteristics that are unique to your company.  Negotiations should be just that, an ability to speak about what a company reasonably needs to survive without a very short acceptance timeline. 

I have so many more but need to list this one as well.  Station personnel do not know anything about any process other than sorting packages and tracking service.  When we have a question, they rarely have an answer. Often when they do have an answer it's wrong. We have spent so much time finding answers ourselves and completing processes that the terminal should be able to assist with but can't.  It exhausting and frustrating. ","The integration of Express volume should be a good thing for us right?  I'm worried about it.  I haven't heard anything positive about Express integration in terms of profitability or the professional relationship with Terminal staff.  It will change our daily operation and take a lot of work to coordinate with yet again, no financial incentive. ","We have several contracts.  A Contractor about 5 hours away from us walked away from their contract with zero notice.  We were asked to run contingency so we did.  We brought drivers, trucks, ipads, scanners and everything else needed to get it done.  We were up and running in a terminal five hours away from our within two days....we ran for six weeks and had the terminal caught up.  It was a complete shit show.  FedEx missed several payments to us and when we did get paid, it was always the wrong amount.  We floated tens of thousands of dollars to make it happen and had to fight to get paid.  The terminal manager was the worst person I've ever worked with at FedEx.  I made sure that we only communicated via email or text so that I had record of his behavior and ineptitude.  Doing the contingency work hurt our overall service for the company under which we ran contingency.  We took all of the risk and ended up breaking even.  In the end we gave notice and walked away.  We did everything in our power to bail FedEx out and were met with problem after problem on the FedEx side that they were unwilling or too inept to fix.  We will never run contingency again. ","FedEx does not give a shit about contractors.  We work so hard to make things happen for FedEx and don't make great profits.  It's a living and supports my family but it is not worth it.  Contractors take all of the risk, take on all of the liability and do not get compensated commensurately for it.  FedEx has the memory of a gold fish. We bail them out all of the time and are met with a constant barrage of texts, phone calls and email about equipment, service and FedEx specific requirments.  Do not invest in this business unless you can go into it with zero debt. ","Thanks for doing this.  I hope thousands of contractors take this survey and it can be presented directly to FedEx. "
