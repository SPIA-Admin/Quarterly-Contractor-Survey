Survey Question:
Can you share a specific challenge you've faced in the past year and how you addressed it?

Responses:
Bad contracts. FedEx has no clue how the model works or how to deliver packages. 
I've been in the red the last 4 months. I've sold trucks, downsize my fleet, cut drivers, and contacted a consultant. I'm still bleeding and don't know what to do. I've requested a renegotiation but still awaiting BDS to get back with me. 
Fedex lack of understanding on financial struggles of contractors as contracted rates continue to fall when compared to required expenses to service the contract. 
Lost 220,000.00 last year
All the changes that FedEx keeps making. Just keep costing us moreoney and contracts keep going down
Used profits from contingency services to cover pay raises and upgrade fleet. No money to do that in the current contract without contingency. 
Taxes, debt- currently refinancing my house to solve it
Took over an open CSA in Jan 2023.  Rates turned out to be dismal, out of step with local wage demands.  Experienced contingency situation in December with corresponding financial penalties.  Did not renew contract.  Lost ~$300,000 .
A separate contract went bad and threatened to bankrupt both of my companies.  I had to make the difficult decision to sell that business at a loss so I could focus my attention on strengthen the health of this contract.
BDS targets specific contractors if they don't like them.

Survey Question:
Describe a recent success story or a significant milestone your company achieved.

Responses:
None because I don't care enough to achieve milestones anymore. 
We've been successful every year in the past. This year no milestones have been set. Just setbacks due to no profit.
Gold medal status
13 months without a accident
3 years accident free, 1 full year 100% service
Gold medal status for full calendar year. And still going
Almost perfect service
Seven years of operations without going bankrupt.  Six years without falling into contingency.  
I was able to work with my bank and secure a continuation agreement on my SBA loan that had become severely defaulted.
Just passed 12 months without a missed pickup or pickup out of window. 
ChatGPT
The survey responses present a mixed picture of recent successes and milestones achieved by companies. While a few respondents share significant accomplishments, such as maintaining accident-free records and achieving "gold medal" status for excellent service, others express a lack of motivation and frustration due to financial struggles and setbacks.

Achieving "gold medal" status for a full calendar year.
Maintaining a record of 13 months and 3 years without accidents.
Achieving almost perfect service and passing 12 months without missed pickups.

However, there is also a notable sentiment of disillusionment among some respondents who report no recent achievements and express a lack of interest in setting milestones due to ongoing financial difficulties and lack of profit.

A particularly insightful response comes from a contractor who shared: "I was able to work with my bank and secure a continuation agreement on my SBA loan that had become severely defaulted." This highlights a significant financial achievement and the proactive steps taken to ensure the company's stability amid challenging circumstances.

Get rid of bds. Useless.

2 way listening
I feel we are not partners, us against them
Pay is our fair pay 
Ability to negotiate a contract, not have to accept the value FedEx First and Last Mile has determined for it. 
Come up programs that the contractor can make extra money and not focus on new programs that take more money away
Stop having contractor forums if nothing is ever going to change
Honesty.

Survey Question:
Are there any upcoming industry changes or trends that you believe will impact your business positively or negatively in the next year?

Responses:
Express could take us or we could take express. Either way I wonâ€™t stick around to find out. 
Express 
Maybe the election. From  Fedex prospective the only thing I know that is changing is the Express Merger. Certainly haven't heard anything positive about this new model.
No
Express will be more challenging and no profit
Express is going to make us inefficient, with time deliveries.  Medals are based on efficiency.
Positive and Negative- network 2.0 and smaller contractor profit margins will lead to more contingency opportunities. 
Inflation continues to kill operating margins with no relief in the contract
Mostly company-specific.  EV's are only trending with 1) entities who can afford the exorbitant purchase price and 2) locations with appropriate infrastructure. Further, End-of-life values are unknown, making the economics uncertain.    Wage pressures are going to become a serious problem in areas with robust growth.  Weather concerns, specifically increasing days with high temps and longer than normal duration are going to take a toll!  AC in trucks is actually counter-productive.

Survey Question:
Share an experience that exemplifies your relationship with the company your contract is with.

Responses:
Experienced gray hair and very poor health
NA
There is no relationship between the contractor and Fedex. They dictate everything and we have to do what the contracts tell us to do or we loose our contract. Certainly a one way street.
Safety inspections with otc threats show continued lack of understanding of contractor challenges
I never seen a company work so hard to work against me
2nd generation CSP (purchased the business from my Father in 2021) and Iâ€™ve been with the company from the start in 2008. What started with 1 truck has grown so much. 
Lack of consistency. Signature Violation will either result in a Disqualification or get swept under the rug. They have no consistent application of standards
Fell into contingency for the first time since starting operations in Jan 2017.  We now owe $60,000, about 1.5 weeks of revenue.  In the past, such financial penalties were RARE.  Now, it's year-round.  
I was threatened with an OTC because my shoes were grey and not black.

Survey Question:
What's one thing you wish outsiders knew about the challenges and rewards of being a Service Provider contractor?

Responses:
No reward. Don't buy in. 
I can't think of any rewards. I used to make a pretty good salary but that certainly isn't the case. I wish I could tell outsiders that this company is challenging in so many ways but pays really well and has a really great contractor relations commitment, but that's not the case. Just keep the shareholders happy on the backs of starving contractors and falling drivers.
Fedex management doesn't understand the financial health of their contractors
Too much risk, not enough reward
One sided contact they are fully in control.
"Challenges: The emotional strain of trying to keep your business efficient, safe, and profitable all while caring for the employees and their families, and most importantly not neglecting your own family while you do all this. 
Rewards: Having the opportunity to watch the growth not only of your business, but of your staff also is pretty rewarding! "
It's a small business with high capital risk and margin compression has significantly limited the business model
FINANCIAL REWARDS ARE LIMITED, as compensation allows for a set amount of margin.  Negotiations are not negotiations, just a discussion of the allocation of an engineered revenue amount.  CLOSE SECOND:  Good help is hard to find and hard to retain.
The current market is tough to make a profit in, but it is doable.
Accountability only goes one way within Fedex. Contractors have to be perfect, but Fedex can work on their issues for months with no improvement.
