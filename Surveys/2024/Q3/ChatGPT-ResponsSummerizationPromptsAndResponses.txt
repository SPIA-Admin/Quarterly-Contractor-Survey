Survey Question:
Can you share a specific challenge you've faced in the past year and how you addressed it?

Responses:
Labor and fuel costs addressed by using more AVP as well as not taking an owner salary and supplementing with other business interests income


The size and weight of our packages keep increasing while the overall volume has not. To avoid burn out and injuries we are forced to staff based on package size and bulk deliveries vs volume.
The number of large and heavy packages are the biggest challenge.  We pull off a few stops off drivers to alleviate their burden.

Had a death


Discrimination - Sexual harassment - went to court - got a permanent restraining order 
Maintenance and ICâ€™s have drastically increased 

I have low employee turnover in the past, but have had one driver move out of area and another planning to move. The costs associated with onboarding and ramping up new drivers could be what takes out ability to maintain a profitable business.



Reduced compensation on last contract renewal increased route capacities
Due to large package size we've had to reduce stop count (can't fit). We run an inefficient bulk truck to reduce cubic feet in other trucks. Th

Lack of quality mechanics 
Acquired 4 dedicated routes this past year and needed new trucks to service it, leased them through REL.
Labor cost, sadly no raises for drivers and they are not happy. running 53% labor

Poaching of drivers and wage wars within terminals once contractors start failing. No success so far.
Constant changes of policy/ expectations 





Cost of everything has gone up and fedex is paying less or not enough to compensate inflation 
Loosing money and have taken from my retirement fund
Concern with continuing to contract with fedex based on safety scores 





Labor maintaince 
"FedEx is not seeing the size of the packages and the bulk deliveries as a daily issue. Every day we have at least one stop in both csas that take an entire truck or two to deliver an hour away from the terminal. Bulk stops from 50-250 packages that are coolers, outdoor smokers, furniture, etc 

We also have several new residential developments popping us in our CSA and new houses means ordering more furniture. Yes, my drive efficiency is not where you want it to be. THATS BECAUSE I CANNOT ANY MORE PACKAGES IN THESE TRUCKS!!!! Yesterday we had a wheel borrow with a label on it from Walmart. It is literally being shoved in our faces everyday and we continue to bend over and take it. Meanwhile the negotiators are telling us that we need to dispatch less people. Itâ€™s a crazy time to be an isp. Zero confidence that FedEx will fix this issue, they continue to turn a blind eye. Thereâ€™s a reason one district has an open CSA in every building right now. We cannot continue to lose money, I know of at least 8 contractors in 4 different buildings is once accident away from being bankrupt. LCC is a joke and is probably illegal but they do it anyway"

Summary
Responders to the survey highlighted significant challenges faced in the past year, primarily revolving around labor and fuel costs, the increasing size and weight of packages, and the resulting strain on resources. Many have had to take drastic measures to manage these issues, such as not taking owner salaries, supplementing income from other business interests, and adjusting staffing based on package bulk rather than volume to avoid burnout and injuries. One respondent dealt with a particularly severe issue of sexual harassment, resulting in a court case and a permanent restraining order.

The responses also revealed common problems like rising maintenance costs, employee turnover, and the financial strain of onboarding new drivers. Some have experienced reduced compensation on contract renewals, necessitating increased route capacities and running inefficient bulk trucks. The general sentiment expressed a deep frustration with FedEx's policies and payment structures, which have not kept pace with inflation and operational costs. This has led to reduced driver wages and dissatisfaction among staff.

Several respondents expressed concerns about the sustainability of continuing their contracts with FedEx, given the financial losses and the company's perceived indifference to the issues of large and bulky package deliveries. Some have even resorted to taking money from retirement funds to stay afloat. The overall tone of the responses was one of frustration and a lack of confidence in FedEx's ability or willingness to address these challenges.

Summary
Respondents shared their recent success stories and significant milestones, with a general focus on safety achievements and operational efficiencies. Many celebrated accident-free records, with one respondent highlighting a two-year streak and another noting over three years without incidents. Achieving Tier 4 safety status and gold ISP status were also mentioned as significant milestones. Additionally, one company managed to improve its Ryde scores, reflecting better operational performance.

Cost-saving measures were another common theme, such as switching workers' compensation providers to reduce expenses. Some respondents expressed relief in avoiding bankruptcy, which, while not a traditional success, was framed as a significant achievement given current challenges.

However, not all responses were positive. A few respondents indicated that they have not experienced significant successes, emphasizing that they are merely managing to "get by" amidst ongoing difficulties.

Responses:
They have got to share some of the wealth they are making by moving express to the contractors.
Customer Experience what about Driver Experience 

Adjust our contracts based on inflation 

The unknown if express will come or not to us.
Honest open dialog between negotiations, contractors and management..Too much gaslighting 
Stop gaslighting us



Increased Revenue to help offset higher costs 
Transparency 
Fair negotiations 

Communication from corporate beyond the filtered down version that we receive. Do they value service partners or are shareholder expectations taking precedence.
More transparency, higher contracted rates
Better contract rates

With district requirements, FedEx imposes on contractors and their drivers there has to be more compensation to offset those costs to succeed
1st, a fair (higher) contract, we've been operating paycheck to paycheck for three years!  2nd, eliminate efficiency as a medal metric (massive package sizes have got to be considered.  Every contract should be allotted bulk trucks w/o moving us into silver)

Adequate pay to work AND quality demand. 
More opportunities to dialog with regional and district LH managers.
Look at the amount of business going under, listen to the struggling contractors, get boots on the ground! Ride alongs and see that 140 stops a route is not feasible in most rural suburban areas. Numbers are skewed for failure. Get real numbers with boots on the ground! Support your contractors so we can pay a reasonable wage! Help us get group discounts on trucks, gas and insurance etc. 

To have FedEx be more open and willing to resolve issues.
Stop changing policies/expectations 

Reverse the margin erosion



Kindness and empathy. Fedex treats us like a number, if we could work together things would be a lot easier. 
Pay a reasonable stipend 
Stop throwing the contract/agreement in our faces and take more accountability for your poor terminal performance 


More realistic settlement rates. X making it's growth & profit numbers on the backs of contractors, and it's own terminal personnel. 
Healthier settlement rates


For them to actually do their jobs. Contractor relations transformed to Business Development Solutions and failed at that! Their  entire job was in the title of the name! Developed Businesses to get them ready for  the ISP contract. Calls and emails are never returned, been getting the same answer for 6 years now, â€œwe will look into it and get back with youâ€ and then you never hear from them ðŸ˜† itâ€™s unbelievable. Then if you try to follow up with them and keep pressuring them, they give you the standard contract/corporate line that itâ€™s in the agreement. Theyâ€™re not trying to help us, corporate treats them like a joke too! How can BDS answer isps questions and concern when they havenâ€™t even been told the new information yet? Same goes for safety, our safety guy didnâ€™t even know about the new AI cameras that are due Oct 1, corporate is so far removed from what we do as contractors isnâ€™t isnâ€™t even funny. If Scott Ray and Scott Burns would just show up to a building unannounced instead of providing an itinerary of when they will be in which buildings at what time maybe then they will see the issues, until then nothing will change. We will continue to spin our gears, terminate contracts, fire SRMs and ignore the real issues that plague our beloved FedEx company. I have been a contractor for a long time and I love this brand but I hope they get the message but it really feels like they donâ€™t care about the isps, package handlers or terminal/hub employees. They have really gotten away from their roots and itâ€™s sad. We finally had a good contract for years during Covid but then FedEx ripped it all back to make the shareholders happy. The packages that we deliver now should never go through our system. Over the last 2 weeks we have had; an anvil on a pallet, 5 full size trash cans from Grainger with a label slapped on the lid, a full size wheelbarrow from Walmart, tractor chains, road sign poles banded together in groups of 10 that weighed over 150lbs that took 3 package handlers to get it on the belt and not to mention the daily couches, sectionals, grilles, lawnmowers, trampolines, beds, cat litter machines, office desks, outdoor patio sets and this is just to name a few. CHARGE THE SHIPPERS MORE, THEY LITERALLY CANT GO ANYWHERE ELSE. UPS wonâ€™t take the big stuff and usps canâ€™t fit itâ€¦

Summary
The responses to the survey question about contractor relationships with their companies reveal a mix of experiences, predominantly skewed towards negative sentiments. Many contractors expressed feelings of frustration and disillusionment due to poor communication, lack of support, and a perceived lack of respect and fairness.

Several contractors highlighted that the relationship was more positive and collaborative in the past, but has deteriorated over time. Common issues include being given insufficient time for contract negotiations, unanswered communications, and a one-way communication style that only benefits the company. Weekly meetings with constant threats of consequences and poor handling of operational issues were also frequent complaints.

On the positive side, a few respondents mentioned recognition and involvement in special events and leadership groups, indicating some level of appreciation and engagement from the company. However, these positive experiences were overshadowed by the more widespread negative sentiments.

The struggle of getting furniture type packages to the customers door without damages



It's a 24/7 business and takes a lot of hard work to squeak out a profit! 
Corporate greed will put you out of business 
Profits are not guaranteed and donâ€™t get paid enough to provide benefits 

Biggest challenge is despite all the very well known increases due to inflation, including to suppliers of their goods, contractors continue to have reductions in the rates paid to provide additional duties to the contractor. Though profits continue to increase on one end, those profits are not passed through but rather are coming at our expense.



FedEx doesnâ€™t care anything about contractors. We are a dime a dozen in their minds. They continually push new policies and equipment requirements that we are forced to maintain, Cutting into our little margins , or jeopardize the contract that they have the right to change or terminate at any time. 
It's mentally rewarding owning your own business and employing people, but based on the work you do 7 days a week, it's not financially rewarding.  Only having a one-year at a time contract adds additional anxiety.  It is a difficult job, but there are good people in the industry.

Summary
The survey responses regarding the challenges and rewards of being a Service Provider contractor with FedEx reveal a predominantly negative sentiment. Many respondents highlighted the instability and financial strain of the relationship, emphasizing that FedEx's control over contracts and policies makes it difficult to sustain a profitable business. Contractors expressed frustration with the constant changes in policies and equipment requirements, which cut into their already thin margins.

Several contractors mentioned the significant investment required and the ease with which they can lose their business, pointing out that the contracts are delicate and can be terminated by FedEx at any time. The impact of inflation and the lack of rate increases to match rising costs were also major concerns.

While some respondents noted the mental rewards of owning a business and employing people, they also stressed that the financial rewards are minimal, especially given the demanding nature of the work. The imbalance between risk and reward was a recurring theme, with many expressing regret over entering the business and advising against it due to the high risk and low reward.
