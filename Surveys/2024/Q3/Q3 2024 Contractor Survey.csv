Every day we have at least one stop in both csas that take an entire truck or two to deliver an hour away from the terminal. Bulk stops from 50-250 packages that are coolers, outdoor smokers, furniture, etc 

We also have several new residential developments popping us in our CSA and new houses means ordering more furniture. Yes, my drive efficiency is not where you want it to be. THATS BECAUSE I CANNOT ANY MORE PACKAGES IN THESE TRUCKS!!!! Yesterday we had a wheel borrow with a label on it from Walmart. It is literally being shoved in our faces everyday and we continue to bend over and take it. Meanwhile the negotiators are telling us that we need to dispatch less people. It’s a crazy time to be an isp. Zero confidence that FedEx will fix this issue, they continue to turn a blind eye. There’s a reason one district has an open CSA in every building right now. We cannot continue to lose money, I know of at least 8 contractors in 4 different buildings is once accident away from being bankrupt. LCC is a joke and is probably illegal but they do it anyway","Ha","For them to actually do their jobs. Contractor relations transformed to Business Development Solutions and failed at that! Their  entire job was in the title of the name! Developed Businesses to get them ready for  the ISP contract. Calls and emails are never returned, been getting the same answer for 6 years now, “we will look into it and get back with you” and then you never hear from them 😆 it’s unbelievable. Then if you try to follow up with them and keep pressuring them, they give you the standard contract/corporate line that it’s in the agreement. They’re not trying to help us, corporate treats them like a joke too! How can BDS answer isps questions and concern when they haven’t even been told the new information yet? Same goes for safety, our safety guy didn’t even know about the new AI cameras that are due Oct 1, corporate is so far removed from what we do as contractors isn’t isn’t even funny. If Scott Ray and Scott Burns would just show up to a building unannounced instead of providing an itinerary of when they will be in which buildings at what time maybe then they will see the issues, until then nothing will change. We will continue to spin our gears, terminate contracts, fire SRMs and ignore the real issues that plague our beloved FedEx company. I have been a contractor for a long time and I love this brand but I hope they get the message but it really feels like they don’t care about the isps, package handlers or terminal/hub employees. They have really gotten away from their roots and it’s sad. We finally had a good contract for years during Covid but then FedEx ripped it all back to make the shareholders happy. The packages that we deliver now should never go through our system. Over the last 2 weeks we have had; an anvil on a pallet, 5 full size trash cans from Grainger with a label slapped on the lid, a full size wheelbarrow from Walmart, tractor chains, road sign poles banded together in groups of 10 that weighed over 150lbs that took 3 package handlers to get it on the belt and not to mention the daily couches, sectionals, grilles, lawnmowers, trampolines, beds, cat litter machines, office desks, outdoor patio sets and this is just to name a few. CHARGE THE SHIPPERS MORE, THEY LITERALLY CANT GO ANYWHERE ELSE. UPS won’t take the big stuff and usps can’t fit it…","Addition of FedEx2.0 will destroy us if they don’t figure it out soon ","N/a","I would have figured out a different career path ",""
