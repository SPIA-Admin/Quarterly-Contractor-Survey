Survey Question:
Can you share a specific challenge you've faced in the past year and how you addressed it?

Responses:

Driver accidents. Better training

Reducing trucks/routes per day to improve efficiency while keeping good drivers happy.





Lack of profit



Hiring 
Drivers, just keep hiring 

Cut routes and increase load on existing drivers to try to cut some expenses



Inflation. Things have increased in price. Truck repairs, labor, insurance, and unrealistic settlement weekly. 

With the massive increase in package size & weight we can't fit as many packages in each truck and are penalized for being inefficient.  We run extra trucks for overflow every day and are penalized for being inefficient.  We've had two guys out with injuries for several weeks a piece because of heavy packages (one with hernia that still needs surgery, second one with shoulder tear that needs surgery)

Added 7 zip codes 2 of which never got added to my contract so i serviced them for a loss of $50000, which i hope to make back in peak
Lower contract rates, cut spending 


FXG is woefully behind in technology and planning prowess
Keeping consistent staff 
Lack of support 


Payroll, paying veteran drivers what they are worth. There is no money in our contract to promote  drivers

With our debt service payment we have no chance of the owner making a single dollar this year. Only option is to continue to improve efficiency & hang on as long as possible. 
Had to take money out of retirement as cash depleted, able to charge lower interest than a bank 
Rising cost 
Schedule L, it is super hard for new small contractors. I am a 4 on SRI and 2 on schedule L

I have replaced close to 10 engines this year. Most on 2021 vehicles. They all crapped out at about 90,000. That with my contract cut about $150,000 killed me

Was sued be previous owner. Worked out payment plan. 


ChatGPT
Summary

Survey Question:
If you could suggest one change to improve contractor relations, what would it be?

Responses:

Transparency

Focus on poor contractors, increase pay for good performance and safe contracts. Longevity of a contract means nothing and it should count for more. A lot more. 





More revenue



Disconnect between Corp and contractors 
More pay

FedEx needs to realize that if they want A+ top shelf, contractors with top notch quality drivers, and uphold a A+ image and quality delivery they need to pay more on contracts
Pay


Listen to contractors not engineers. 

Increase pay.  The job is NOT what it used to be.  Package size/weight is ridiculous now and we can't afford to pay these guys what they're worth with current contract rates!

Improve pay, business stops and icâ€™s are out of hand we cannot fit hundreds of stops on a truck like you think



Increase reimbursement rates to CPI

Fed Ex support
Stop micromanaging the contractors and letâ€™s work together to provide the best service in the industry.

Be honest and look at how the contractors are struggling and realize that being greedy in a business where they make all the profit 

Only having to deal with one main point person. Two many chiefs running around giving our company orders
Address what the future holds, do they realize contractors are having financial difficulties?
More money for contracts 
Communication 

They must increase rates to keep up with inflated costs

Property account for the cost of labor in my market. 


ChatGPT
Summary
Respondents overwhelmingly call for better financial terms and communication improvements. There's a strong demand for increased compensation, more transparent communication, and less micromanagement. Contractors seek more recognition for their tenure and performance in contract terms.

Survey Question:
What's one thing you wish outsiders knew about the challenges and rewards of being a Service Provider contractor?
Responses:

Costs











Election will play a big role
Peak season in a negative way





No

Negatively.... FedEx getting more contracts for huge packages.  We know what senders are paying FedEx to ship these packages.  How about cutting us in on a FAIR share!

More express and ground closures.  Wil i be next





No
The integration of Express into our terminal is definitely going to be a challenge but I am optimistic that it will be a positive transition 

Express

The election 
We are not 2.0 yet, short term negative but hopefully long term positive 
Cost/inflation 
Wage inflation and FedEx ability not recognize it and compensate us for it

2.0 will probably increase our gross earnings but Iâ€™m afraid the extra work and effort will offset it for the negative. 

FedEx Hround' integration with Express is being used to "right" CSA's they don't like.


ChatGPT
Summary
Contractors express the demanding nature of their roles, the financial and operational constraints, and a lack of autonomy. The sentiment of being treated more like employees despite bearing business risks is strong. They desire recognition and fair treatment from the corporations they contract with.
"The contractors are controlled as managers, directly employed by FedEx, but assume all the risk and responsibility of a business owner. Contractors have very little control of how to run their businesses or improve on their businesses. FedEx continually audits our payroll they claim is for compliance like we are not controlled legally by our local state and governments. I feel FedEx uses this Payroll audit as their inside line on our costs and give us just enough on contracts to keep our heads above water."

Survey Question:
Share an experience that exemplifies your relationship with the company your contract is with.

Responses:




















Great track record
Not treated as partners.  They donâ€™t care about our success.
We do a good job and have a good working relationship with our local management.  It is engineering and upper management that are not allowing us to be paid well based on how they build our contracts.  We should not be breaking even every week, we should be paying our guys a salary based on what this job requires....and we can't.  







Na




The day after the recent hurricane two managers with the contracted company said they would dispatch 8,000 terminal wide because of all the closures. We staffed that night & they dispatched 16,000 the next day .  Huge mess that morning & we had to write a letter explaining why we didnâ€™t have enough staff. That sums it up
Quite frequently assist with sort and cleaning up the terminal 
N/a


I do what I can to take care of our joint customer and FedEx. They know they can rely on me to do a good job. But they keep making it harder and harder to do our job: delivery accurately, safely, and enthusiactly the packages. 
One sided, no true negotiation, bully techniques.
Yet another cut in contract value despite increased labor costs. With the current numbers, even paying less then market rate leaves my payroll close to 60% of revenue.

Survey Question:
What's one thing you wish outsiders knew about the challenges and rewards of being a Service Provider contractor?

Responses:



It's a hands on business. You need to know it inside and out. You cant just pay someone and expect them to do it for you.  There's no room in the budget.









Owning business is never easy
The terminal sucks and doesn't care, they treat you like an employee 

The contractors are controlled as managers, directly employed by FedEx, but assume all the risk and responsibility of a business owner. Contractors have very little Control of how to run their businesses or improve on their businesses. FedEx continually audits our payroll they claim is for compliance like we are not controlled legally by our local state and governments. I feel FedEx uses this Payroll audit as their inside line on our costs and give us Just enough Un contracts to keep our heads above water



Very rewarding just pay needs to increase. 
We donâ€™t make much.
It's all challenges at this time.  HUGE packages, high turnover, increased costs of doing business....and contracts that stay the same or get decreased....EVERY YEAR.  I have advised people to not become contractors until FedEx starts making the contract actually worth something more than a break-even point.

Work all the timeâ€¦but you can work remote a decent bit.  Fedex is always changing, be able to adapt multiple times a month





The over the top oversight


That our contracts are the bare minimum to operate the trucks

Challengers-You donâ€™t own your company. You are an employee. Havenâ€™t found a reward yet
We try to make our drivers experience the best career possible with the budget limitations we have 
 Tough business


Be kind to our drivers because they work very hard. 
Extremely difficult to build a company/culture when you have little control.
FedEx is currently trading the stability of their network for short term shareholder profits.
